# Tool for Tracking Club Growth

We've integrated tools into Slack for you to track the growth of your club. You aren't obliged to use these but it can be helpful to keep track of how your club attendance changes over time. It's also nice for HQ to have some data on which clubs are active.

To log a meeting use:

`/meeting-add yesterday, [number] people`

for example if you ran a 15 person meeting:

`/meeting-add yesterday, 15 people`

To get a chart like that shown in the banner above

`/stats @username`
