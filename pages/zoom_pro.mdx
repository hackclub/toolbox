# Zoom Pro for Hack Clubbers

We offer Zoom Pro meetings to every Hack Clubber via <a href="https://js-slash-z.hackclub.com/">/z</a>!

To start a Zoom Pro meeting, simply type `/z` anywhere in the Hack Club Slack.

## Google Calendar Integration

If you want to schedule meetings ahead of time (& give people a Zoom link), we also built a Google Calendar integration. Here's how to install it:

1. Open [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com)
2. On the right, click the `+` button

3. Search for `/z`

4. Install the app

5. Once it's installed, create a calendar event. select `Zoom Pro Meeting` from the dropdown (if it doesn't appear, try refreshing—it will eventually appear).

We think /z is at feature parity with having your own paid Zoom Pro account. We even cancelled our own HQ Zoom Pro accounts and have been entirely using /z since February. That said, if you find something you need that isn't in /z, or you discover any bugs, please let us know in the `#hq` channel on Slack, or DM `@msw`.

# Zoom Pro for Hack Club leaders

**HQ is buying a Zoom Pro account for every Hack Club this semester.**

_Note: We're only paying for Zoom Pro accounts through the end of this semester. We're developing `/z` and once it reaches the point where we're using it instead of our Zoom Pro accounts at HQ, we intend to switch all clubs to it._

_`/z` in beta is currently available to use by anyone - both leaders and members - but for now full Zoom Pro accounts still have more features._

This is only available to your club’s point of contact; the point of contact then can create meetings for the club. If you’re not sure if you’re the point of contact, running the command will let you know who that this. If the point of contact is the wrong leader, reach out to @matthew or @msw.

## How to redeem

1. Sign into the Hack Club Slack
2. Type `/get zoom pro`
3. Accept your email invite & sign up
4. Have fun!
