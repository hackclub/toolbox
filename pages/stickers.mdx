# Stickers for Hack Clubbers

This is only available to club leaders. If you should be marked as a club leader but aren’t, please reach out in #hq on Slack. If you’re looking to start a club, [apply here](https://apply.hackclub.com).

Since most Hack Clubs are meeting online, we’ve brought [@melinda](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U018B5U27CH) onto the Hack Club team to ship stickers to your members on your behalf.

## How to request sticker shipments

1. Sign into the Hack Club Slack
2. To send an envelope, run `/get sticker envelope @memberusername` once for each of your members. To send to yourself, just use your own @username, or if someone isn’t on Slack, put their email address, like this: `/get sticker envelope memberemail@domain.com`
3. If we don't already have their address on file, they'll receive either a Slack DM or an email asking for the best mailing address (depending on whether a username or email was given)
4. As soon as we get the address, there's a friendly envelope in their future!

To be clear: If you have 20 people in your club and want to send Hack Club stickers to all of them, you'll need to run `/get sticker envelope @memberusername (or memberemail@hackclub.com)` 20 times, once for each member. If your club is large, that's OK! We want to send stickers to every member.

### With great power comes great responsibility

This is a system built on trust. Every shipment request is manually reviewed by someone at HQ and every sticker shipment is personally prepared, packed, and mailed - with the address hand written - by [@melinda](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U018B5U27CH) from Greenbrae, California.

We are relying on you to be a responsible user of it. Stickers are funded by donations to Hack Club and are not cheap - every package costs real donor money.

It's OK to use this system for good faith creative purposes. Meet someone cool and want to send them some Hack Club stickers? Great! That's awesome. Exactly what this is for.

It is not OK to abuse this system. Do not send stickers to anyone without their consent. Do not request exessive shipments. If we come to the conclusion that you've been abusing sticker shipments, you'll be discharged from Hack Club.

If you’re running an event / need a full box of stickers, let staff know! We’re not distributing them automatically but we’d be happy to send them.
