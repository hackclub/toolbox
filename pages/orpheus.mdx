# Orpheus

Orpheus is your best friend on the Hack Club Slack, whilst they may be a dinosaur they are very helpful.

### General Commands

These are commands relevant to all Slack members, whether or not they are leaders.

Sometimes HQ may wish to ship you things, if you move you can update your address by running:

`/address`

If you believe someone has broken the CoC, you can report them by running:

`/report`

HQ offers a set of freebies to Hack Clubbers, you can redeem them by running:

`/get`

If you need a breakout channel on Slack you can run:

`@orpheus breakout`

### Club Administration 

Sometimes when running your club, you may need to update the data HQ has about your club. Orpheus let's you do that.

To view and get a link to edit your club's address run:

`/club-address`

To view your current leader group run:

`/leader-list`

If that list is missing someone you can run:

`/leader-add @username`

### Tracking Club Growth

We've integrated tools into Slack for you to track the growth of your club. You aren't obliged to use these but it can be helpful to keep track of how your club attendance changes over time. It's also nice for HQ to have some data on which clubs are active.

To log a meeting use:

`/meeting-add yesterday, [number] people`

for example if you ran a 15 person meeting:

`/meeting-add yesterday, 15 people`

To get a chart like that shown in the banner above

`/stats @username`
