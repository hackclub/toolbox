# Stickers for Hack Clubbers

This is only available to club leaders. If you’re looking to start a club, [apply here](https://apply.hackclub.com).

## How to request sticker shipments

1. Sign into the Hack Club Slack
2. DM [@Tevan](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0278J0HRJ6) (if you are in the APAC region, DM [@Harsh Bajpai](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U010XUNLX40))
3. Make sure to include your address (if you're sending stickers to someone else, include their full address)
4. Let us know if the stickers are just for 1 recipient, or for a whole club. If it's for a club or hackathon, include your attendance count.

This is a system built on trust. Every shipment request is manually sent someone at HQ, and every sticker shipment is personally prepared, packed, and mailed - with the address hand written.

We are relying on you to be a responsible user of it. Stickers are funded by donations to Hack Club and are not cheap - every package costs real donor money.

It's OK to use this system for good faith, creative purposes. Meet someone cool and want to send them some Hack Club stickers? Great! That's awesome. Exactly what this is for.

If you’re running an event & need a full box of stickers, let staff know! We’re not distributing them automatically but we’d be happy to send them.
