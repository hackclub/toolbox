# Repl.it for Hack Clubbers

[repl.it](http://repl.it) is an online IDE for coding in just about any language in your browser. We’ve secured [Hacker plans](https://repl.it/pricing) for all Hack Clubbers, free for a year!

In order to keep the codes within the Hack Club community, you can only access the Hacker Plans if you're a club leader. However, as a club leader you're welcome to share the code with all of your club members and any Hack Club community members you see fit. As a general rule for who to share Hacker Plans with, [check out the guidelines we wrote on the sticker page](/stickers#responsibility)—the same rules apply.
